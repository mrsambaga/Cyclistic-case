# Install Packages

```{r}
install.packages("tidyverse") #Package for various data processing & visualization
install.packages("Tmisc") #Package for statistical calculation
install.packages("magrittr") 
install.packages("dplyr") #Package for R pipe
install.packages("chron") #Package for date time processing
```



# Import Dataset

```{r}
Combined_Dataset <- read.csv("C:/Users/SAMBAGA/Desktop/Bangkit/Google Data Analytics/Case Study/Case Study 1/Dataset/Combined_Dataset.csv")
```
```{r}
head(Combined_Dataset)
```

# Basic Statistical Analysis

```{r}
Combined_Dataset %>%
  summarize(mean_weekday = mean(day_of_the_week), std_weekday = sd(day_of_the_week), variance_weekday = var(day_of_the_week))
```
```{r}
Combined_Dataset %>%
  summarize(duration_mean = mean(times(ride_duration)), duration_std = sd(times(ride_duration)), duration_var = var(times(ride_duration)))
```


# Basic Visualization

```{r}
ggplot(data=Combined_Dataset, aes(x=member_casual))+
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = 1.5, colour = "white") +
  labs(title="Cyclistic Membership", y="Total", x="Membership Type")
```
```{r}
Combined_Dataset$day_of_the_week <- recode(Combined_Dataset$day_of_the_week, 
       "0"="Sunday",
       "1"="Monday",
       "2"="Tuesday",
       "3"="Wednesday",
       "4"="Thursday",
       "5"="Friday",
       "6"="Saturday")
Combined_Dataset$day_of_the_week <- factor(Combined_Dataset$day_of_the_week, levels = c("Monday", "Tuesday", "Wednesday", "Thursday", "Friday", "Saturday", "Sunday"))
```
```{r}
ggplot(data=Combined_Dataset, aes(x=day_of_the_week, fill=member_casual))+
  geom_bar() +
  geom_text(aes(label = ..count..), stat = "count", vjust = 1.5, colour = "white") +
  labs(title="Number of Ride in Day of The Week ", y="Total", x="Day of the Week")

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
